Observations and Inferences Based on the Data

Based on the summary statistics, two drugs, Capomulin and Ramicane, seem to be effective for reducing tumor sizes. Both presented about 40 mm3 tumor sizes on average. This size was more than 10 mm3 smaller than the average tumor sizes of mice with other drugs. 

In addition, SEM for 40 mm3 was about 0.32 with Capomulin and Ramicane. This SEM was smaller than that with other drug therapies. This small SEM could indicate that these drugs work with various mice relatively equally without leaving any mice failing to reduce their tumor sizes or increasing their tumor sizes unexpectedly (There was no outliers among the tumor sizes for any mice with Capomulin and Ramicane. All the tumor sizes were between upper band and lower band of IQR). 

About 50% of mice was female, and the other half was male. This could indicate that potential impact by gender difference on the effectiveness of drugs was controlled. In other words, the effectiveness of Capomulin and Ramicane was not probably associated with gender. 

There were a few limitations of this study: 
1)	the numbers of data points for both Capomulin and Ramicane were bigger than those with other drugs. In general, larger the size of data is, smaller the standard error and standard deviation are.  A small SEM mentioned above might potentially be the function of the larger amount of data for these two drugs instead of the indication of the stable effectiveness of these two drugs.
2)	Further investigation for the effect of Capomulin revealed a positive relationship between the final tumor size and the weights of mouse. This could potentially indicate that this drug may/may not work with the patients with heavy weights. Can we then recommend for the heavy weight patients to use Ramicane instead of Capomulin in the future?  Investigation for the weight-tumor size relationship was conducted only with Capomulin. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that Ramicane could work with the heavy weight patients at this point.
